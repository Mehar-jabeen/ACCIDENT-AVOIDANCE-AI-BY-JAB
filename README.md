# ACCIDENT-AVOIDANCE-AI-BY-JAB

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
   ACCIDENT-AVOIDANCE-AI-BY-JAB
MY idea is to create a detector using artificial intelligence 
by applying the techniques in autonomous vehicles .


## Background
  The main cause for the idea is accidents that i come across while travelling which are frustrating. we are going to attach this detector with camera infront of the four wheelers or heavy engine vehicles


## How is it used?
 This can be used to avoid accidents and prevent from accidents. Image recognition in this is used to detect the vehicle in the opposite and the spped detector will detect the speed of the vehicle.

## Challenges

Since this is an AI it has its limitations
    it should be implemented in all four wheelers to prevent accidents otherwise this will not be effective and image recognition of views of vehicles can be hard

## What next?

since i have designed this in a particular way by focusing on the front side it can be futher developed to other sides too
